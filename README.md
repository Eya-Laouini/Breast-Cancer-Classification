# Breast Cancer Classification Project

## Project Overview
In this machine-learning project, we aim to differentiate between benign (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) breast tumours. The classification is based on quantitative features extracted from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses. Using the Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data Set, the project utilizes a range of features that describe the characteristics of the cell nuclei present in the images.

## Objective
The primary goal is to construct a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier. This is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that uses 'nearness' to classify data points to predict the classification of new data points, hence determining the likelihood of malignancy in breast tumours.

## What is Classification?
Classification in machine learning is the process of predicting the category of a given data point. In this project, it is a two-class classification problem where we predict if a tumour is benign or malignant based on the input features.

## Dataset
The dataset provided by sklearn.datasets includes 569 instances of cancer cases, each with 30 attributes, or features, that provide details about the cancer cells' characteristics. Features like the texture, radius, and perimeter of cells are numerical and require careful normalization to be useful in prediction.

## Prerequisites
To run this project, you need Python 3.x and the following libraries: NumPy, pandas, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn. Install them using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Files in the Repository
- `breast_cancer_classification.py`: Contains the model and visualizations.
- `README.md`: Describes the project and instructions on how to run it.

## How to Run the Script
1. Clone the repository or download `breast_cancer_classification.py`.
2. Ensure all prerequisites are installed.
3. Run the script with a Python interpreter: `python breast_cancer_classification.py`.

## Features and Target
The dataset contains features such as mean cell radius, texture, and smoothness, which are derived from the cell nuclei characteristics in the image. The target variable is binary, indicating the class of the tumour: 'malignant' or 'benign'.

## Model Training and Evaluation
The Python script orchestrates the machine learning workflow including dividing the dataset into a training set for fitting the model, and a testing set for evaluation. The model's performance is assessed using accuracy metrics, a confusion matrix (which shows true positive, false positive, true negative, and false negative counts), and a classification report (which includes precision, recall, and F1-score).

## Visualization
The script visualizes data relationships using a heatmap, which is a graphical representation of data where individual values contained in a matrix are represented as colours. It's particularly useful for spotting correlations between features, which can influence model selection and feature engineering.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! You can:
-Enhance the model's performance by fine-tuning the KNN algorithm's hyperparameters.
-Compare the KNN model with other machine learning algorithms, like SVM or decision trees, to evaluate different approaches.
-Improve the project's data visualizations by adding more insightful graphical representations of the data and the model's performance.
